      %p
        Join the Munich tech community and meet new people. We're all working on something or facing problems that others have seen. Meeting your community will help you to get better.
      %p
        Our interests go way beyond Ruby. We love to search for the new approaches and develop innovative stuff. Clojure, Scala, C, scalability, databases and more.
