# Munich Ruby User Group

We're bringing the Munich developer community together to share their knowledge and build a powerful network.

Register for the next meetup on 15th of May [here]:(http://munichrug.wufoo.com/forms/z7x3x5/), offer a talk [here]:(https://github.com/munichrubyshift/munichrubyshift.github.com/wiki/Talk-Proposals).

## Community

Join the Munich tech community and meet new people. We're all working on something or facing problems that others have seen. Meeting your community will help you to get better.

Our interests go way beyond Ruby. We love to search for the new approaches and develop innovative stuff. Clojure, Scala, C, scalability, databases and more.

## Knowledge sharing

Expand your knowledge lighting fast! Tell everyone about a project you have recently built, problem you have solved. Hear about others' experiences and learn from them.

Got something to share? Offer a topic for discussion or leave a talk proposal [here]:(https://github.com/munichrubyshift/munichrubyshift.github.com/wiki/Talk-Proposals).

## Hacking

Hack something new together? Join or find an open source project that's looking for contributors, or get some help from people who use your libraries and have ideas about how to improve what you've done.
