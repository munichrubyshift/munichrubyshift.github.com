      <h2>Community</h2>
      <p>
        Join the Munich tech community and meet new people. We're all working on something or facing problems that others have seen. Meeting your community will help you to get better.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our interests go way beyond Ruby. We love to search for the new approaches and develop innovative stuff. Clojure, Scala, C, scalability, databases and more.

      <p>
        Expand your knowledge lighting fast! Tell everyone about a project you have recently built, problem you have solved. Hear about others' experiences and learn from them.
